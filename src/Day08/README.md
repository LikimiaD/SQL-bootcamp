Please use the command line for PostgreSQL database (psql) for this task. You need to check how your changes will be published to the database for other database users. 

Actually, we need two active sessions (i.e. 2 parallel sessions in the command line). 

Please provide a proof that your parallel session can’t see your changes until you will make a `COMMIT`;

See the steps below.

**Session #1**
- Update of rating for "Pizza Hut" to 5 points in a transaction mode.
- Check that you can see a changes in session #1.

**Session #2**
- Check that you can’t see a changes in session #2.

**Session #1**
- Publish your changes for all parallel sessions.

**Session #2**
- Check that you can see a changes in session #2.


So, take a look on example of our output for Session #2.

    pizza_db=> select * from pizzeria where name  = 'Pizza Hut';
    id |   name    | rating
    ----+-----------+--------
    1 | Pizza Hut |    4.6
    (1 row)

    pizza_db=> select * from pizzeria where name  = 'Pizza Hut';
    id |   name    | rating
    ----+-----------+--------
    1 | Pizza Hut |      5
    (1 row)

You can see that the same query returns different results because the first query was run before publishing in Session#1 and the second query was run after Session#1 was finished.

Please use the command line for PostgreSQL database (psql) for this task. You need to check how your changes will be published to the database for other database users. 

Actually, we need two active sessions (i.e. 2 parallel sessions in the command line). 

Before running a task, make sure you are at a standard isolation level in your database. Just run the following statement `SHOW TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL;` and the result should be "read committed".

If not, please set the read committed isolation level explicitly on a session level.

Please check a rating for "Pizza Hut" in a transaction mode for both sessions and then make an `UPDATE` of the rating to a value of 4 in Session #1 and make an `UPDATE` of the rating to a value of 3.6 in Session #2 (in the same order as in the picture).
