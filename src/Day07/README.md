Let's make a simple aggregation, please write a SQL statement that returns person identifiers and corresponding number of visits in any pizzerias and sorts by number of visits in descending mode and sorts by `person_id` in ascending mode. Please take a look at the sample of data below.

| person_id | count_of_visits |
| ------ | ------ |
| 9 | 4 |
| 4 | 3 |

Please modify an SQL statement from Exercise 00 and return a person name (not an identifier). Additional clause is we need to see only top 4 people with maximum visits in each pizzerias and sorted by a person name. See the example of output data below.

| ------ | ------ |
| Dmitriy | 4 |
| Denis | 3 |

Please write a SQL statement to see 3 favorite restaurants by visits and by orders in a list (please add an action_type column with values 'order' or 'visit', it depends on the data from the corresponding table). Please have a look at the example data below. The result should be sorted in ascending order by the action_type column and in descending order by the count column.

| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Dominos | 6 | order |
| ... | ... | ... |

Write an SQL statement to see how restaurants are grouped by visits and by orders, and joined together by restaurant name.  
You can use the internal SQL from Exercise 02 (Restaurants by Visits and by Orders) without any restrictions on the number of rows.

In addition, add the following rules.
- Compute a sum of orders and visits for the corresponding pizzeria (note that not all pizzeria keys are represented in both tables).
- Sort the results by the `total_count` column in descending order and by the `name` column in ascending order.
Take a look at the example data below.

| name | total_count |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dominos | 13 |
| DinoPizza | 9 |
| ... | ... |

We know personal addresses from our data. Let's assume that this person only visits pizzerias in his city. Write a SQL statement that returns the address, the name of the pizzeria, and the amount of the person's orders. The result should be sorted by address and then by restaurant name. Please take a look at the sample output data below.

Please write a SQL statement that returns aggregated information by person's address, the result of "Maximum Age - (Minimum Age / Maximum Age)" presented as a formula column, next is average age per address and the result of comparison between formula and average columns (in other words, if formula is greater than average, then True, otherwise False value).

The result should be sorted by address column. Please take a look at the example of output data below.

| address | formula |average | comparison |
| ------ | ------ |------ |------ |
| Kazan | 44.71 |30.33 | true |
| Moscow | 20.24 | 18.5 | true |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
