Take a look at the Graph on the left. 
There are 4 cities (a, b, c and d) and arcs between them with costs (or taxes). Actually, the cost is (a,b) = (b,a).

Please create a table with named nodes using structure {point1, point2, cost} and fill data based on a picture (remember there are direct and reverse paths between 2 nodes).
Please write a SQL statement that returns all tours (aka paths) with minimum travel cost if we start from city "a".
Remember, you need to find the cheapest way to visit all cities and return to your starting point. For example, the tour looks like a -> b -> c -> d -> a.

Below is an example of the output data. Please sort the data by total_cost and then by tour.

| total_cost | tour |
| ------ | ------ |
| 80 | {a,b,d,c,a} |
| ... | ... |

## Exercise 01 - Opposite TSP

| **Allowed**                               |                                                                                                                          |

Please add a way to see additional rows with the most expensive cost to the SQL from the previous exercise. Take a look at the sample data below. Please sort the data by total_cost and then by trip.

| total_cost | tour |
| ------ | ------ |
| 80 | {a,b,d,c,a} |
| ... | ... |
| 95 | {a,d,c,b,a} |
