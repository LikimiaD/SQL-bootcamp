Write an SQL statement that satisfies the formula `(R - S)∪(S - R)` .
Where R is the `person_visits` table with a filter through January 2, 2022, S is also the `person_visits` table but with a different filter through January 6, 2022. Please do your calculations with sets under the `person_id` column and this column will be alone in a result. Please sort the result by the `person_id` column and present your final SQL in the `v_symmetric_union` (*) database view.

(*) To be honest, the definition of "symmetric union" doesn't exist in set theory. This is the author's interpretation, the main idea is based on the existing rule of symmetric difference.

Please create a Database View `v_price_with_discount` that returns the orders of a person with person name, pizza name, real price and calculated column `discount_price` (with applied 10% discount and satisfying formula `price - price*0.1`). Please sort the result by person names and pizza names and convert the `discount_price` column to integer type. See a sample result below.

Please create a Materialized View `mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats` (with data included) based on the SQL statement that finds the name of the pizzeria where Dmitriy visited on January 8, 2022 and could eat pizzas for less than 800 rubles (this SQL can be found at Day #02 Exercise #07). 

To check yourself, you can write SQL to the Materialized View `mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats` and compare the results with your previous query.

Let's refresh the data in our Materialized View `mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats` from Exercise #06. Before this action, please create another Dmitriy visit that satisfies the SQL clause of the Materialized View except pizzeria, which we can see in a result from Exercise #06.
After adding a new visit, please update a data state for `mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats`.
